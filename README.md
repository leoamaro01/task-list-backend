# Task List

This is a back-end source code of the Task List app for the cuban.engineer technical test.

Download the front-end web app from [here](https://www.github.com/leoamaro01/task-list) to view this app in real action.

This was made using Fastify as a framework, with MikroORM for database management. An SQLite database was used to store the data.

To run the server, you must execute the following commands:

```shell
npm install
```

To install dependencies, and:

```shell
npm start
```

To start the server on port 8080.

# Testing

You can also run:

```bash
npm test
```

To launch the (admitedly small) suite of tests using Vitest.

# Dependencies

The project depends on Node.js v22.14.0 and npm v10.9.2, which are the latest LTS releases at the time of writing.
